1. Please make sure the paths are correct or not.
2. Make sure you included annotation driven tag or not in your spring context xml file.

You need to include these two tags to load resources into your application.

<mvc:annotation-driven />
<mvc:resources mapping="/resources/**" location="/resources/" /> 

These resources are there in under webcontent folder in a structured web application.
