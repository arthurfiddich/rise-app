He was one of the few Scottish players to escape untarnished by the 44-0 defeat by South Africa during the period. Elliot was the only Scot to be named by the South African rugby correspondent R.K. Stent amongst the best players who had faced the 1951-2 Springbok tour to the British Isles. Allan Massie talking of the 1950s, said: ""Elliot was my first Rugby hero, and for a long time in the Fifties, he was the only one a Scots boy could have... the Scottish sides he played in, especially in the Fifties, gave him little chance to display his attacking abilities. All the same, match reports of the time make frequent mention of Elliot bursting from the line-out to run thirty yards... He was undoubtedly the nearest thing to a forward in the classic All Black mould that Scotland produced in the twenty years after the war, for he was fast also, possessed all the basic skills, and breathed aggression. It was fitting that almost his last game for Scotland was against the All Blacks in 1954, when he captained the side that held the tourists to a single penalty goal. "" Bill McLaren remembers in 1947 going for a Scotland trial, and playing at the back of the line-out, ""the only time the ball was thrown anywhere near there and I got it I found myself enmeshed in a vice-like grip. The feeling was of two iron bands imprisoning my arms. The bands belonging to Douglas Elliot, one of the greatest Scottish wing-forwards, whose strength had been developed in his every-day life as a son of the soil. I was much impressed by the form of temporary paralysis he imposed on my arms and it did not surprise me that he remained Scotland's most capped wing-forward with 29 appearances until John Jeffrey gained his 30th cap in the second Test against the All Blacks in Auckland in June 1990."""

Elias Constantine,"Elias Constantine (22 May 1912 – 22 May 2003) was a Trinidadian cricketer who played first-class cricket for Trinidad between 1932 and 1949. He was the younger brother of Learie Constantine, who represented West Indies in Test matches; his father Lebrun and uncle Victor Pascall also played representative cricket for West Indies and Trinidad. Constantine's father, Lebrun, was the grandchild of slaves, who rose to the position of overseer on a cocoa estate in Cascade, near Maraval, where the family lived when Elias was born. Lebrun was famous on the island as a cricketer who represented Trinidad in first-class cricket and toured England twice with a West Indian team. Constantine's mother, Anaise Pascall, was the daughter of slaves;. Constantine grew up with his family in Cascade on the estates for which his father was overseer. The family were generally happy and frequently practised cricket together under the supervision of Lebrun and Victor Pascall. By 1932, Constantine had followed his relations into the Trinidad cricket team. He made his first-class debut against Barbados on 16 January in the Inter-Colonial Tournament, and scored 30 in his only innings. He later bowled 11 wicketless overs in a comfortable Trinidad win. According to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, ""he was so quick in the field that his team-mates reputedly congratulated him when he dropped a catch on his Trinidad debut, because no one else could have got close. "" In the following game, the final of the tournament, Constantine scored 92 not out and took his first two wickets in first-class cricket as Trinidad won the competition. As matches in the West Indies were limited, Constantine played just once in each of the following two seasons, achieving nothing of note. In the following season, he played in one of the matches against the Marylebone Cricket Club which was touring West Indies. For the only time, he played a first-class match with his brother Learie. They opened the bowling together when their team fielded. When Trinidad batted, they were reduced to 42 for six before the brothers came together and added 93 runs, of which Elias made 37. The match was eventually drawn. During the Trinidad Test match, played shortly afterwards, Constantine was chosen as twelfth man purely because of his reputation as an outstanding fielder. In the first 11 years of his career, he only twice passed fifty in a first-class match, and he bowled infrequently. Even so, Learie Constantine hoped that Elias would be chosen for the 1939 West Indies tour of England. Elias even paid his own expenses to travel to the trial matches in Trinidad, but was not selected for them and he did not make the tour. In the mid-1930s, Constantine joined his brother in playing English league cricket; he appeared for Rochdale Cricket Club in the Central Lancashire Cricket League, playing as an all-rounder. Constantine did not play any first-class cricket between 1936 and 1939. His best performance came in 1944, when he scored his only first-class hundred; he hit 139 runs against British Guiana, hitting five sixes. He continued to play for Trinidad until 1949; all but one of his first-class games was played for Trinidad. In total, he scored 895 runs at an average of 27.12 and took 24 wickets with his medium-paced bowling. He died in Trinidad on his 91st birthday on 22 May 2003."

Later in the game, Carter became ""delirious and weak"" and was taken to a Boston hotel where he was in critical condition. Newspapers reported that Carter ""has been insane ever since the accident. "" After graduating from Harvard, Hallowell remained affiliated with Harvard's football team as coach from during the period from 1893 through at least 1901. Hallowell remained a fierce supporter of Harvard's football team. When Hallowell was married, the congregation in the ""sedate"" Boston church gasped when he knelt at the altar.

They eventually won the division title by five games over the second-place Cubs. Cambria did not appear in the 1970 NLCS, which the Pirates dropped in three straight games to the Cincinnati Reds.

Fred Laycock,"Frederick Walter Laycock (31 March 1897 – 19 September 1989) was an English professional footballer who played as an inside forward. He was born in Sheffield. He began his career in local football with St Mary's and Shirebrook. After a spell in the Midland League with Rotherham Town, Laycock signed as a professional with Sheffield Wednesday in March 1923. However, he failed to make a first-team appearance for the club and moved on a free transfer to Football League Third Division North side Barrow the following year. At Holker Street, Laycock scored 10 goals in 31 league matches. Said to be an outstanding header of the football, his form for Barrow attracted other clubs to his signature. At the match against Rotherham County on 16 March 1925, the final day for transfers in the 1924–25 season, several clubs sent representatives to sign the player. While the game was in progress, Laycock was called from the field of play to sign for Third Division North rivals Nelson, before completing the rest of the match for Barrow. Both Laycock and Nelson were later fined over the incident, Laycock receiving his punishment for illegally representing Barrow while contracted to a different club. Laycock made his Nelson debut four days later in the 2–0 win against Hartlepools United at Seedhill. He scored his first goal for the club the following week in the 1–0 victory away at Rochdale, the team's third consecutive win. However, Nelson's form then faltered as they took just one point from the next three games. Laycock netted twice in the 7–0 defeat of Crewe Alexandra on 13 April 1925, the biggest winning margin Nelson ever achieved in the Football League. Later in the month, he scored four goals in two matches against Wrexham and Southport. Laycock continued his goalscoring form into the following season, but was then dropped to the reserve team. He scored 18 goals in the Lancashire Combination as the Nelson reserves won the league for the first time. Laycock returned to the first-team in April 1926 and scored three goals in the last five matches of the 1925–26 campaign, including two in the 3–3 draw with Chesterfield. In the summer of 1926 Laycock moved into non-League football with Mansfield Town, where he spent one season before returning to the Third Division North with New Brighton. He had a record of a goal every other game for the Wallasey-based club, ending the 1927–28 season with 14 goals in 28 appearances. Laycock switched club again in September 1928, joining Southern Football League club Peterborough & Fletton United on a free transfer. Another move to Darlington in the summer of 1929 meant a third spell in the Football League for Laycock. His record of 14 goals in 35 matches helped Darlington to a third-placed finish in the league, but Laycock was released at the end of the season and signed for York City. During a single season with the Fulfordgate club, he netted 12 times in 27 League appearances. Laycock moved to Third Division South outfit Swindon Town in May 1931, his 11th new club in as many years. He made his debut for them in the 3–2 defeat against his former club Mansfield Town on 29 August 1931, and scored his first goal for the side in the following fixture, a 4–1 victory over Watford at the County Ground. Despite playing regularly for the first three months of the season, he was used only sparingly in the latter stages of the campaign. Laycock scored his second and last Swindon goal on the final Football League appearance of his career, in the 4–0 win against Gillingham on 9 April 1932. After leaving Swindon in July 1933, he had a spell in Northern Ireland with Derry City before returning to the English non-League game with Witton Albion in October 1934. Laycock subsequently assisted several non-League sides, including Nuneaton Town and Cannock Town. He had trial periods with Northwich Victoria and Shrewsbury Town in 1936, and joined his final club, Hereford United, in January 1937. Laycock returned to Sheffield at the end of his playing career and died in the city on 19 September 1989, at the age of 92."

Freddie Brooks (sportsman),"Frederick George ""Freddie"" Brooks, OBE (1 May 1883 – 5 September 1947) was a Rhodesian sportsman who represented his country as both a cricketer and rugby union player. He also played a Test match for the England national rugby union team. Brooks, although born in India, was educated at Bedford School in England. As well as captaining their cricket team and playing rugby, Brooks was also outstanding in athletics, becoming Public Schools champion in the 100 yard sprint, 110 yard hurdles, long jump and high jump. From 1900 to 1902, he played cricket for Bedfordshire in the Minor Counties Championship. At the age of 19, Brooks was offered a civil service job in Rhodesia by William Henry Milton, the Administrator of the British colony. He had found out about the sporting abilities of Brooks by his two sons, rugby players Cecil and Jumbo, who were also students at Bedford School. After immigrating to Salisbury, he impressed enough in his first season of club cricket that he earned the praise of former South African Test captain and Rhodesian resident H. H. Castens, who believed that Brooks ""was good enough to play for South Africa"". Brooks also won a Rhodesian tennis title and became the national record holder in high jump. He took part in Rhodesia's inaugural first-class match, in 1905, against Transvaal in the Currie Cup cricket competition. Batting at three, Brooks top scored in the first innings with 61 of his team's 115 runs. In the second innings he opened the batting but made just one before being bowled by Richard Norden, who claimed 12 wickets for the match. In 1906 he represented the Rhodesian rugby team in South Africa's Currie Cup as a wing three-quarter. He was considered unlucky to miss selection in the Springbok team to tour England in 1906/07 as he didn't meet the five year residential qualification period, albeit by only a few months. Springbok vice-captain Paddy Carolin had wanted Brooks in the team and told him to come with them to England, at which time he would sent a telegram to the Rugby Board seeking permission to call up Brooks as a replacement player. While in England, Brooks again played rugby for Bedford and was selected in the South vs North fixture, which was used as a trial for spots in the national team. He scored four tries and despite coming to the country to play for the Springboks, Brooks was named in the England team for a Test against the South Africans. The match, which was played at Crystal Palace, finished in a three all draw, with Brooks scoring England's only points though a second half try. He got further opportunities to play for England, against both France and England, but turned them down in order to get married back in Rhodesia. When HDG Leveson-Gower's XI toured Rhodesia in the 1909/10 cricket season, Brooks was picked to make his second and final first-class appearance. After managing just 10 in his first innings, Brooks was again promoted from three to open the batting in the second innings and made 51. His career in the civil service would see him made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, having served as Master of the High Court and Chairman of the Public Service."

Frederic Waldock,"Frederic Alexander Waldock (16 March 1898 – 4 July 1959) played first-class cricket for Oxford University and Somerset between 1919 and 1924, and then for representative sides in his native Sri Lanka between 1927 and 1934. He was born at Colombo, Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) and died at Galmington, Taunton, Somerset. Waldock was educated at Uppingham School and from 1918 was at Hertford College, Oxford. As a cricketer, he was a left-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler. With county cricket resuming after the First World War in a fairly ad hoc manner in the 1919 season, Oxford University's first-class fixtures that year were largely against scratch teams of amateur cricketers, and Waldock was a regular player for the university side throughout. In the match against the MCC at Oxford, he made 85, and this would remain the highest score of his first-class career. The game just before the 1919 University Match was against a side raised by H. D. G. Leveson Gower at Eastbourne; Waldock took seven first-innings wickets for 46 runs and then scored 80 of a first-wicket partnership of 166 with Miles Howell. Waldock was awarded his cricket blue and was also elected secretary for the 1920 Oxford season; in its notes on the 1919 Oxford season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said that ""Waldock did so well... that people began to talk about him as the coming left-hand bat"". In the 1919-20 rugby union season, Waldock was awarded his Oxford blue as well; he played at stand-off half. The 1920 cricket season saw Waldock as an established member of the Oxford University cricket team and as secretary the expectation was that he would go on to captain the team in 1921. That did not happen because Waldock left the university at the end of the summer 1920 term. The 1920 Oxford team was very strong in both batting and fielding. Waldock was singled out in the season report in Wisden for his fielding at mid-off, though it added that his batting was a ""disappointment"". His highest score for the university side was only 46 and with Reg Bettington and Greville Stevens in the team, his bowling was scarcely used at all. After Oxford University had played Somerset in early June, however, Waldock played for Somerset in the county team's next match against Warwickshire at Bath. And when the university season was over in early July, he joined Somerset to the end of the season, and scored consistent runs for the team, with a highest of 78 in the match against Worcestershire at Worcester, where Wisden reported that he ""found the batting form which had quite deserted him while he was playing for Oxford"". In the 1920 season as a whole, Waldock made 849 runs at an average of 21.76; he did not bowl for Somerset. After the 1920 season, Waldock did not return to Oxford and disappeared from first-class cricket for three years. He reappeared in four matches for Somerset at the start of the 1924 season, but those were his last games in English first-class cricket.

Prior to his professional career, Dibert played college football at Swarthmore College. However, Dibert first played outside of college with the Allegheny Athletic Association in 1890, because the Pittsburgh Athletic Club did not field a football team until 1891. In early October 1890, Dibert and two other Pittsburgh Athletic Club members played for the ""All-Pittsburgh's"", an informal collection of local players, in a pick-up game game against Allegheny Athletic Association. The following season, he played for both Pittsburgh Athletic Club and Allegheny Athletic Association. In a game between the Athletic Association and the Cleveland Athletic Club, Dibert's punting skills were credited with keeping Cleveland deep within their own territory and added an important field goal in 6–6 tie between the clubs.

In 1893, he became the first football player to sign and be kept under to the first known professional football contract with the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. The contract covered all of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club games for the 1893 season, and paid Dibert $50 per game. While the signature on that piece of paper is barely recognizable, most sports historians believe that the player who signed the contract was probably Dibert. Still remaining on the paper are the remnants of two letters from the signature, a high loop that could be the top of a ""b"" and, after a short space, the crossed top of a ""t"". A copy of the contract is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, in Canton, Ohio. Dibert opened the 1893 season in the Pittsburgh backfield, but lost his position after the fourth game of the season. Although he was mentioned later in the season as an available sub, he did not play for the team again. It is unknown if Dibert was paid for only the games he played in or if he was given money, just to prevent him from playing for Allegheny."

The 6 ft, 180 lb Fanok signed with St. Louis in 1959 after attending what is now the Morristown-Beard School and Hanover Park High School, where he was a baseball standout. After four seasons in minor league baseball, originally as a third baseman before converting to pitching, he began the 1963 season as a member of the MLB Cardinals' pitching staff.

But Fanok allowed 21 bases on balls and 24 hits, and was told to change his customary three-quarters throwing motion to a straight overhand delivery by Cardinal manager Johnny Keane. Sent back to Triple-A Atlanta to find his rhythm, Fanok pitched well — striking out 146 batters in 127 innings — but suffered his arm injury late in the season. He would make only four more appearances in the Majors, for the 1964 Cardinals, and he retired from baseball after the 1967 campaign.

In 1949–1950, with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Double-A Southern Association, Fisher batted .397 and .423 in successive seasons, although, as a pitcher (and part-time outfielder in 1950), he was well short of enough at bats (58 and 156, respectively) or plate appearances to win the SA batting championship. He appeared in 18 Major League games with the 1951–1952 Pittsburgh Pirates — ten as a pinch hitter and eight as a pitcher. In his first trial with the 1951 Bucs, Fisher was used exclusively in a pinch hitting role, going hitless in three at bats. In 1952, he began the season with the Hollywood Stars of the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League until his recall by the Pirates. In his first game back with them, on June 21, he got his first Major League hit, a pinch single of Carl Erskine of the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. He would pinch hit three more times until he took the mound July 2 for his first MLB pitching assignment; in relief of Ron Kline, he allowed no runs and two hits in two innings of work in a 3–0 Pittsburgh defeat at the hands of the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. Two days later, on July 4 at Crosley Field, Fisher got his first starting assignment in the Majors, and he defeated the Cincinnati Reds 5–2 for his only big league victory. Fisher worked six innings and scattered five hits, allowing two earned runs, and left the game with the lead, 3–2. Fisher made ten more appearances for the Pirates that season, six as a pitcher, losing his last two starts to the Boston Braves on July 13 and New York Giants on August 1. Returning to minor league baseball, he played through 1959 (sitting out the 1955 season), gradually logging more time in the outfield to take advantage of his batting prowess. As a Major Leaguer, he gave up 17 hits and 13 bases on balls in 18⅓ innings pitched, recording five strikeouts. As a batter, he hit .278; his five MLB hits included one double and he had one run batted in."

He is the uncle of the former Kent cricketer Danny Kelleher. Kelleher was a right-arm fast-medium bowler with a whippy bowling action and a tail-end left-handed batsman. Having played for the second team since 1952 in the Minor Counties, he made a sensational first-class debut for Surrey at the age of 26 in 1955, taking five Worcestershire wickets for 23 runs in the first innings of the match at The Oval and following that up with five for 50 in the second innings for match figures of 10-73. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he ""made fast-medium deliveries lift on drying turf"". He never surpassed either the first innings figures or the match figures. But in the strong Surrey side of the 1950s, Kelleher was unable to retain his place and at the end of the 1955 season he left the county and joined Northamptonshire under special registration. He immediately went into the Northamptonshire first team and retained his place across the damp summer of 1956, often opening the bowling with the England fast bowler Frank Tyson. Wisden noted that he ""did well in a year when pitches were not in the main suited to his medium-fast bowling"". In all matches, he took 55 wickets at an average of 28.38. As with his Surrey career, his best day was his first one: in the opening match of the season against Nottinghamshire he took five wickets for 85 (and Tyson took four for 59) in Nottinghsmahire's first innings, and these would be the best innings figures of his Northamptonshire career. The 1957 season, when Northamptonshire finished as runners-up to Surrey in the County Championship, was the most successful in the county's history, but most of the bowling success was down to Tyson, who took 100 wickets in a season for the first time, and the three slow bowlers, George Tribe, Jack Manning and Michael Allen, who took 305 Championship wickets between them. Kelleher took just 44 wickets in 22 matches and his bowling average, 26.90, contrasted with the county's other bowlers, all of whom averaged less than 20 runs per wicket. In 1958, he played in three early matches, but took only one wicket, and lost his place in the attack to Albert Lightfoot, who supplemented his occasional bowling with useful batting, a skill Kelleher never aspired to. He left Northamptonshire at the end of the 1958 season."

Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to bat, making 238 in their first-innings, during which Knutton bowled twenty wicketless overs. Responding in their first-innings, Warwickshire made 248 all out, with Knutton being dismissed by Richard Hardstaff for 4 runs. In their second-innings, Nottinghamshire made 146 all out, during which he bowled six overs. Warwickshire reached 97/4 in their second-innings, at which point the match was declared a draw. It was in this same year that he first played in the Lancashire League for Enfield, making a single appearance for the club. The following season he also made another appearance for Enfield in the league, before making a third and final appearance for the club in 1903. The year previous to that Knutton had been playing in the Bradford League when he was selected to play a hastily arranged first-class fixture for an England XI (which contained one former Test player in Willie Quaife) against the touring Australians at Park Avenue, Bradford.

Winning the toss and electing to bat first, the Australians made 402 all out in their first-innings. Knutton, who was the only fast bowler in the side, finished with figures of 9/100, including taking the first eight Australian wickets to fall: Trumper, Noble, Hill, Darling, Hopkins, Duff, Armstrong, and Carter, before taking the final wicket to fall, that of Saunders. Despite this, the Australians were still able to amass a large total, mostly down to Duff's 182. Responding in their first-innings, the England XI made 240 all out, with Knutton being dismissed by Noble for 8 runs. Forced to follow-on, the England XI were dismissed for 203, with Knutton contributing being dismissed for 5 runs by the same bowler. Requiring 41 for victory, the Australians reached their target with three wickets down, one of which (Darling's) fell to Knutton. He finished with match figures of 10/117. He never appeared in first-class cricket again, but did continue to play in the Bradford League, where he took thousands of wickets.

Between 1888 and 1923, Page held a teaching post at Cheltenham College. According to his Wisden obituary, Page was a ""capital batsman, possessing strong defence and good hitting power. He was also a medium-paced bowler with a curl from leg and a break from the off, could keep a good length and was to be relied on. In the field he was hard-working and excellent, being safe in any position. "" Jack Hobbs claimed in 1935 that Page could bowl the googly while at the University in the 1880s, some time before Bernard Bosanquet is credited with the delivery's invention. Hobbs' source was Kingsmill Key, a contemporary of Page at Oxford and later a captain of Surrey; however, Key stated that Page merely bowled it as a distraction and never used it in a first-class match.

He was the 28th player selected in the 1986 NFL Draft, the first player drafted in the second round of a year in which there were only 27 first-round picks. His selection was controversial, as he did not score particularly well in the pre-draft combines, and there were more-heralded linebackers still on the board. Walker was a latecomer to organized sports, not playing football until high school coaches and his older brother convinced him to join the team in his senior year of high school. A quick and aggressive player, he was a starter all four years at Jackson State University, where he also played power forward for the basketball team. In his senior year, he led the team with 131 tackles, was named to two All-American teams, and was named Southwestern Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year. While the Buccaneers staff were impressed with his raw talent and saw him as a potential Ted Hendricks-type player, the fans were critical of the selection of a player with so little training and experience. Walker started only nine games for the Buccaneers, all in 1987. Although popular with teammates and a standout on special teams, he never worked his way into the regular lineup. Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins at one point toyed with the idea of taking advantage of his athleticism by converting him to tight end, but dropped the idea due to lack of interest from Walker. When Plan B free agency began in 1989, Walker was one of the players allowed to leave. He was signed by the New York Jets in 1989 after being left unprotected by the Buccaneers, but was cut from the Jets in training camp.

He played in the National Football League with the Rochester Jeffersons and the New York Brickley Giants (not related to the modern-day New York Giants).

Jerry Nuzum,"Long before O.J. Simpson and Rae Carruth, another professional football player stood trial for murder. His name was Jerry Nuzum, a star halfback at New Mexico A&M before being drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1948. Nuzum, in the words of one Steelers' employee, ""had a face that looked like a monument. "" His chiseled features and his size—he stood 6-foot-1 and weighed 205 pounds—made him easy to remember. He became New Mexico's most publicized suspect, linked by the Doña Ana County sheriff to a murder that shook The victim was Ovida Coogler, an 18-year-old waitress. Everybody called her ""Cricket. "" She vanished during the early morning hours of March 31, 1949, not long after witnesses saw her in a bar with Nuzum and another man. Rabbit hunters found Coogler's body 16 days later on a plateau near Mesquite. The killer or killers dug a shallow grave and threw a few shovels of dirt on her corpse. Sheriff A.L. ""Happy"" Apodaca said Coogler had been raped and murdered. But forensic science and common sense were absent in the Coogler case. Apodaca refused to authorize an autopsy. This cast doubt on how thorough the sheriff cared to be, and it prevented any meaningful investigation from gaining momentum. Then Apodaca arrested Nuzum and tried to obtain a confession using any means he could, fair or unfair. The sheriff told Nuzum he would be charged with murder if he tried to hire a lawyer. Nuzum's arrest remained secret for three days. Nuzum, then 26, caught a break when El Paso Herald-Post reporter Walt Finley looked into the case. Finley had no car, so he rode the bus to Las Cruces to follow up on tips that something odd was afoot in the Coogler investigation. Finley did some digging, found Nuzum in jail and interviewed him. Nuzum said he was innocent, but feared he would be railroaded to satisfy the public's demand for a conviction. A black man, Wesley Byrd, said he also had been targeted in the Coogler case. Byrd, then 27, told Finley the sheriff kept him in jail for 10 days without allowing him to notify anybody. Byrd dropped another bombshell. He said members of the sheriff's staff and the state police took him to the desert, then tried to elicit a confession from him by squeezing his testicles with a bicycle lock. The stories Finley wrote shed light and heat on the law-enforcement machinery of New Mexico. The sheriff freed Nuzum after 12 days. Then the district attorney issued a statement saying: ""Jerry Nuzum has definitely been cleared of in any way being at fault or having any guilty knowledge of the death of Ovida Coogler. "" Edwin Mechem, a Republican who ran for governor of New Mexico in 1950, made solving Coogler's murder a centerpiece of his campaign. He called it ""the Nuzum case. "" Mechem won the election, and Nuzum once more was a suspect. Police arrested him in April 1951 at his home in suburban Pittsburgh. Two years had passed since he had been ""cleared"" by T.K. Campbell, the Doña Ana district attorney. Steelers' owner Art Rooney and head coach John Michelosen stood by Nuzum. One witness testified: ""Jerry wanted to take Cricket home. Cricket said she didn't want to go with him. "" Perhaps the most damaging testimony came from a witness who said he stopped Nuzum as the football player tried to force Coogler into his car, which was new and maroon. Nuzum said he drove away, alone. He arrived home at 2:55 a.m. , according to his wife and landlady. The trucker also left the bar alone. A Las Cruces policeman offered a detailed story that seemed to help Nuzum. He said he and his partner saw Coogler get into a cream-colored 1941 Chevrolet coupe at 3:05 a.m. These accounts and Nuzum's alibi were known to prosecutors two years before. The state had nothing new, but Nuzum's lawyers did. They called a witness named Mary Foy. She told a startling story, saying she had watched two state police officers chase and beat Coogler before putting her into their car. Her vantage, Foy said, was a seat on a parked bus bound for White Sands Proving Grounds. Foy testified that she had gone to Sheriff Apodaca with her story. For its part, the prosecution said it found no corroboration for her account. Even so, the case against Nuzum was damaged so much that it never made it to the jury. Judge Charles Fowler ruled that the prosecution had failed to meet its burden of proof. He gave Nuzum that rarest of courtroom decisions, a directed verdict of acquittal. ""There is a complete lack of evidence to connect Nuzum with the death as charged,"" Fowler said. Spectators in the courtroom applauded. Nuzum's wife, Mary, wept. He leaned over to comfort her, then broke down himself. Nuzum was free at last, but his life would not be easy. His career with the Steelers ended after the 1951 season. He stayed in the Pittsburgh area, where he worked for and eventually owned car dealerships. Few people in western Pennsylvania seemed to focus on his murder trial in Las Cruces. Still, Nuzum said, the case haunted him. He told the Herald-Post in 1983 that it took him 20 years to pay off his legal bills. The stigma of being a murder suspect remained. ""It was so embarrassing to be accused of a crime like that,"" Nuzum said. ""You can't ever live it down. It's a shame that people sometimes hear my name and they don't say anything about my being a car dealer or playing four years for the Steelers. They say, 'He was the one in that case. ' "" Nuzum died in 1997 at age 73. A federal court jury in September 1950 convicted Sheriff Apodaca and New Mexico State Police Chief Hubert Beasley of violating Wesley Byrd's civil rights by torturing him. Each served a year in prison. President Harry Truman later pardoned them. Coogler's murder was never solved."

Then, after his only minor league season, he sustained a career-ending eye injury in December 1958. Schoonmaker threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 feet 11 inches and weighed 190 pounds . A three-sport athlete in his hometown of Lebanon, Missouri, Schoonmaker batted close to .400 in his junior season at Missouri (when the Tigers won the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship) and captained the baseball team during his senior season. After signing with Washington, he appeared in 20 games for the Senators in 1955, batting 46 times; then, after spending 1956 serving in the U.S. military, he spent his mandatory second year, 1957, on the Senator roster, playing in 30 contests but registering only 23 at bats. In 1958, Washington was finally permitted to send Schoonmaker to the minor leagues for much-needed experience, but he batted only .222 in 139 games, most of them with the Charlotte Hornets of the Class A Sally League. That offseason, he underwent surgery after an errant sliver of metal injured his left eye while he was working at a construction job.

Jimmy McNatt,"James Carlos ""Jimmy"" McNatt (December 19, 1918 – December 23, 2000) was an All-American basketball player for the Oklahoma Sooners and the AAU’s Phillips 66ers. At Oklahoma, McNatt led his team to the first-ever NCAA Final Four in 1939, and at Phillips 66, McNatt guided the 66ers (also called the ""Oilers"") to four consecutive AAU national championships (1943, 1944, 1945, and 1946). He was a two-time All-American at Oklahoma (1939, 1940) and a four-time AAU All-American for Phillips 66 (1943, 1944, 1945, 1946). The speedy player came to be known by his nickname “Scat” McNatt, a moniker originally traced back to the term “Boy Scats” which sportswriters had used to describe McNatt’s fast-breaking, sophomore-led 1937-38 Oklahoma Sooners basketball team. McNatt grew up in Norman, Oklahoma, attended Norman High School, and then opted to stay in his hometown to play basketball for the University of Oklahoma. During his collegiate career at Oklahoma, McNatt broke the Big Six Conference single-game scoring record on two occasions. As a junior, he set the mark with 29 points against Iowa State University on February 18, 1939. Then as a senior, he broke his own record with 30 points against Nebraska on February 9, 1940. Another of Oklahoma’s conference rivals in the Big Six was the University of Kansas, coached by the legendary Phog Allen. McNatt’s Sooners teams were coached by Hugh McDermott and Bruce Drake and won back-to-back Big Six Conference championships in McNatt's junior (1938–39) and senior (1939–40) seasons. McNatt was the conference's leading scorer during the 1939-40 season. In the 1939 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, McNatt led his team to the first-ever Final Four. He topped all scorers with 12 points in the national quarterfinals (“Western Regional Semifinal”) as the Sooners defeated Utah State 50-39. In the national semifinal (“Western Regional Final”) against the University of Oregon, McNatt was again the Sooners’ leading scorer with 12 points as the Sooners fell to the eventual-champion Ducks. Both games were played in San Francisco at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. To advance to the Western Regional, the Big Six Conference Champion Sooners first had to defeat Missouri Valley Conference Champion Oklahoma A&M, coached by Hank Iba and led by Jesse Renick, on a neutral court in Oklahoma City one week earlier. After graduating from Oklahoma, McNatt moved on to a career in Amateur Athletic Union basketball, an early basketball league that preceded the National Basketball Association. Though runners up in the 1942 AAU National Tournament with a team featuring McNatt and former Stanford star Hank Luisetti, Phillips 66 won the next four consecutive AAU National Championships, led by the play of McNatt and Gordon Carpenter, both of whom were selected to the AAU All-America teams during these four seasons. In 1943 and 1944, the 66ers defeated Denver’s American Legion team 57-40 and then 50-43 in the tournament-final games. In the 1945 championship game, a 47-46 win over Denver Ambrose, McNatt led Phillips 66 in scoring with 15 points, outdueling Denver star Robert Gruenig. In McNatt’s final season, Phillips 66 defeated the San Diego Dons by the score of 45-34 in the AAU championship game. McNatt was inducted into the Helms Athletic Foundation's Basketball Hall of Fame in 1960. After his basketball career, McNatt worked as a petroleum engineer for the Phillips Petroleum Company, and held numerous supervisory and management positions at Phillips for his entire career, retiring July 1, 1980."

In November 1937, noted sports writer Alan Gould wrote of Wysocki: ""Villanova's sensational John Wysocki, who put on a one man scoring show against Manhattan, had another big afternoon against Detroit. "" Wysocki was also known as a kick-blocker and had three career touchdowns on blocked kicks. In the 1937 Bacardi Bowl, Villanova was trailing Auburn 7-0 in the fourth quarter, when Wysocki and Valentine Rizzo blocked a kick inside the Auburn 15-yard line, and the kick was recovered by a Villanova lineman for a touchdown that led to the final game score of 7-7. Wysocki repeated as an All-American in 1938 despite suffering injuries that prevented him from playing a full schedule. In November 1938, NEA syndicate sports editor Harry Grayson said the following of the two-time All-American:""John Wysocki is a raw-boned kid who made more All-America teams last year than did any other end. As a sophomore Wysocki had little polish. He was just a big fellow with a desire to put on bone-crushing blocks, a fervor for knocking people down, and obsessed with the idea that end play should be confined to the opponent's backfield. There was a finesse to his blistering blocking, brisk tackling and uncanny forward pass receiving this year. He gave Maurice (Big Clipper) Smith a chance to turn the foemen's desire to sock Wysocki into a Villanova advantage. Wysocki was all team player. He was the ideal decoy on pass plays and a demon on defense. Wysocki, a Wilkes-Barre boy, played with a pair of ankles that would have benched a less hardy individual. "" Wysocki was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the third round (21st pick overall) of the 1939 NFL Draft. However, Wysocki instead took a job as a high school teacher and coach. Upon graduating in 1939, Wysocki became a teacher and coach of football, basketball and track at Clifton Heights High School in a suburb of Philadelphia.

He couldn't break into Richmond's team again and instead continued his football career at Coburg, where he played as a centre half back in their 1928 premiership side. When Plant made his first-class cricket debut in 1932, it was as a specialist off spinner. Playing against Tasmania at Launceston, Plant took career best figures of 6-43 as the island state collapsed from 2 for 128 to 171 all out. He then took perhaps the two biggest scalps of his career, Herbert Sutcliffe and Eddie Paynter, when Victoria played against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club at the MCG the following year. An all-rounder, Plant's batting peaked in the 1935/36 season when he made 395 runs at 39.50, including three of his four first-class half centuries. He put on a couple of notable performances early in the summer, starting with an innings of 64 against the Marylebone Cricket Club, who were touring Australia once more. Aside from reaching his then highest first-class score he also chipped in with a couple of wickets. His other memorable effort came against New South Wales at the MCG, where he scored 76 in his first innings and followed it up by having a hand in six dismissals when it was their opponent's turn to bat, two of them wickets and the other four catches. In 1936/37, his final season, Plant was a member of Victoria's Sheffield Shield winning team, having taken part in three matches during their campaign."
