After impressing for the Gymkhana Club, Oluoch first got a call-up to the national side during Kenya's home series against Uganda, where they played 3 List A matches in the end of 2010. Oluoch impressed greatly on his official List A debut, taking an impressive 4 wickets for 32 runs, currently his best bowling figures at the List A level. As a result, the Ugandans were bowled out for 123. Kenya eventually took the series 2–1. Oluoch made it to Kenya's provisional squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup, but eventually did not make it to the final 15-member squad. After a dismal World Cup campaign in which the team lost all of their matches, the selectors axed the under-performing seniors, and put into place a performance-based contracts. Oluoch met that high-performance criteria, and was thus offered a central contract, a high honour, by the board. As a number of players refused contracts offered by the board and left, Oluoch was one of thirteen players who accepted contracts and remained with the governing body. With Cricket Kenya deciding to leave out players who refused contracts, Oluoch received a call-up to play in the team's Intercontinental Cup and Intercontinental Cup One-Day matches against Netherlands to be held away from home. He made his official One-Day International (ODI) debut against the Dutch at Voorburg in that series (the matches he played against Uganda was only given List A status because Uganda was not an ODI cricket playing nation at that time). He took an impressive three wickets on debut. He followed it up with another two wickets in his second ODI. After an impressive performance in the Netherlands, he was selected in Kenya's home series against the United Arab Emirates. He made his first-class cricket in the ICC Intercontinental Cup at Mombasa Sports Club. Oluoch took a handsome 6/121 on debut, but UAE won the match by 266 runs. Captain Collins Obuya's determined 62 could not prevent the hosts from defeat. Following that, as a part of Kenya's preparations for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier, the board announced that the team would play seven unofficial Twenty20 matches in Namibia, followed by games against Zimbabwean franchise teams. Kenya could not manage much on that tour of Namibia, being defeated 6–2, but Oluoch did have an extraordinary T20 game against Namibia in which he took incredible figures of 4 wickets for 6 runs. Namibia were bowled out for 108, but unfortunately, Kenya were bowled out for an even lower 63 all out as the Namibians romped home by 45 runs. Oluoch's elder brother, Nick Oluoch is a wicketkeeper who plays for Kongonis in the East African tournaments."

He began appearing in representative schoolboy sides and made the Australian Young Cricketers team to England in 1977, playing two unofficial One Day Internationals against England Young Cricketers, and an Australian U/19s tour to Sri Lanka, playing in an unofficial Test match. Coached by former Test spinner Rex Sellers, Dolman also showed great promise in Adelaide Grade cricket and played colts matches for South Australia, although he was kept from first-class cricket for two years to mature him. This just intensified support for Dolman, who was being called ""possibly the most innovative bowler in Australian cricket for a decade"" and had former Test player Jack Fingleton calling for his inclusion in the national side before his first-class debut. Dolman finally made his first-class debut for South Australia on 8 January 1982 against Queensland at the Adelaide Oval, taking 4/114 (his best bowling figures) and 2/47. Following his successful first-class debut, Dolman was recruited by Warwickshire County Cricket Club to play in the 1982 Second XI Championship, where he played six matches, taking 39 wickets at 14.90, with a best return of 7/38 against Leicestershire Second XI, and scoring 174 runs at 29.00, with a highest score of 82 against Leicestershire. Called ""a dapper little figure"", Dolman's performances continued to impress, with another former Test spinner, Ashley Mallett, calling him the most exciting spin prospect he had ever seen and English cricket writer David Frith also enthusiastic about Dolman's cricketing future. Oddly, with all these calls for national selection, Dolman's second season of first-class cricket proved to be his last, playing only a single match, against the touring English side on 31 October 1982, taking 2/72. Dolman was never picked again for South Australia but did coach Adelaide University to an A-grade district premiership before retiring from cricket to concentrate on his career, initially as a teacher before switching to consulting not-for-profit organisations on developing sponsorship and fundraising programs and coordinating high profile community programs."

Cleal was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who, with his links to club cricket in Yeovil, was inevitably compared in his brief first-class cricket career to Ian Botham, though his bowling was not as fast. He played for Somerset's second eleven in 1987 and made his first-class debut in the match against the West Indians at Taunton in May 1988, taking four wickets for 41 runs in the touring side's first innings.

As a batsman, his best first-class score came in 1989, with an innings of 30 in the match against Leicestershire and a share of a last-wicket partnership of 70 with Adrian Jones, whose unbeaten 43 was also his highest first-class score. Two seasons, though, were the limit of his first-class career, which was ended by back injury. In List A cricket, he was able to play longer, turning out for Somerset in a few games each season until 1991. He was not successful as a one-day bowler, taking only five wickets in 17 matches and never more than one in any innings. His career ended by his back injury, Cleal returned to education, took both school and university examinations and qualified as a schoolmaster. As of 2011 he is on the staff of Malvern College. Cleal's cheerfulness in adversity brought a warm tribute from his former Somerset captain, Peter Roebuck, who wrote: ""Cleal was a young all-rounder from Yeovil whose career would be cut short by a back injury. Having left school early with a chequered report, he had put all his eggs in the cricketing basket. Not until bad luck befell him did his true character emerge. Undaunted, he went back to school, studied alongside boys five years younger than he was, passed his exams, advanced to college, took his degree and proceeded with a master's course which was passed with flying colours. In his playing days he had been dismissed as a dimwit, a role he seemed happy to fill. As a cricketer he had his days, once winning a match at Old Trafford with a straight six. As his character inspires warmth, so his achievements command respect."""

The son of Henry Groves, an Englishman whose single first-class cricket appearance came in India, Mike Groves was born in New Zealand but brought up in South Africa, where he was educated at Diocesan College, Cape Town. Usually a right-handed middle-order batsman and irregular right-arm medium-pace bowler, he played a single match as an 18-year-old in 1960/61 for Western Province as an opening batsman, scoring 5 and 45. He then came to England and played occasional amateur first-class matches in 1962 before going to Oxford University in autumn 1962 as an undergraduate at St Edmund Hall. Over the next four cricket seasons, Groves played regularly for Oxford University's first eleven cricket team, but in 1963, despite finishing fourth in the university's batting averages with 485 runs at an average of 26.94 runs per innings, he was left out of the team for the University Match and did not win a Blue. His highest score in the season was an unbeaten 74 in the match against Northamptonshire. In 1964, he failed to match either the aggregate or the average, and his only score of 50 or more for the season was 61, but he retained his place through the Oxford season and was awarded a Blue, scoring eight and 10 not out and taking a single wicket, that of Richard Hutton, in the match. Groves played his single full season of first-class cricket in 1965 and had his best year, with 1048 runs at an average of 29.11. He topped the Oxford batting averages with 743 runs at an average of 32.30 and made 69 and 81, his highest score for the university, in the match against Sussex which came immediately before the University Match. In the University Match itself, Groves top-scored for Oxford with 45 in the first innings, but he and fellow batsman Melville Guest were barracked by the crowd for slow scoring, with 15 consecutive maiden overs bowled by the two Cambridge spinners. The slow scoring was uncharacteristic, though Wisden noted that, in an out-of-form batting side and on damp pitches, Groves had not been able in 1965 to bat with the freedom he'd exhibited in previous seasons. After the university term was over, he joined Somerset, and though he began in the second team, for the whole of August he played for the first team, and while there he compiled the highest score of his first-class career, 86, in the match against Derbyshire at Glastonbury. Groves returned for a fourth season at Oxford in 1966 but played only four matches because of examination demands. One of those, however, was his third University Match, and after five consecutive drawn games in this fixture the 1966 match was won by an innings by Oxford, with Groves' unbeaten 80 in 98 minutes on the first day one of the batting highlights, enabling Oxford to declare and give Cambridge an awkward half hour's batting at the end of the day. After the game, Groves again joined Somerset, but this time he played only a handful of second eleven matches and did not feature in the first team, which was having one of its most successful seasons. That was virtually the end of Groves' cricket career, but he appeared over the next 14 seasons in occasional games for either the Free Foresters or the MCC, and in 1967 and 1968 a couple of those games were rated as first-class fixtures: subsequent matches he played in were not first-class. At the end of the 1968 season, with Somerset looking for a new captain to replace Roy Kerslake, there was a move to co-opt Groves to the post, but it did not happen."

He also played for Northumberland for many years in the Minor Counties and appeared for them in one List A match in 1971. He was born in Birmingham. A right-handed lower-order batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler, Latham played for Gloucestershire's second eleven in 1959 and 1960 before switching to Somerset for the 1961 season. He made his first-class debut in the first home match of the season, taking three wickets in the Hampshire first innings (and one in the second) before arriving in the Somerset second innings, as No 11 batsman, with his side still 59 runs short of a target of 172 in a low-scoring match; with Brian Langford he put on 40 before Langford was bowled. Latham's unbeaten 21 proved to be the highest score of his first-class career. He played in only two other first-class matches in the 1961 season. In the 1962 season, Latham played in almost half of Somerset's matches, though with a side full of fast-medium and medium-pace bowlers, he was bowled sparingly. He was the sixth bowler used when he played against Nottinghamshire at Bath and won the match by taking five for 20 in less than 10 overs, bowling off-cutters. But in the second match of the three-match Bath festival of cricket he was still the sixth bowler used in each innings, bowling only six overs in the game, and he was dropped for the third match. Selected again a couple of weeks later, he took five for 61 in Yorkshire's first innings in the game at Taunton on a batsman's pitch. And in his final match of the season, an innings victory over Northamptonshire at Weston-super-Mare his four for 54 in the Northants first innings was the best of the Somerset bowlers. That, however, proved to be the last first-class match of Latham's career as he left the Somerset staff at the end of the season ""to take up employment in engineering"", and though he was expected to be ""available for some matches"", that did not happen. Instead, Latham moved to North-East England and began playing Minor Counties cricket for Northumberland, appearing for them for 10 seasons through to 1972. In 1971, he made his only List A appearance, an all-Minor County Gillette Cup match against Lincolnshire in which he made an unbeaten 26 with the bat but failed to take a wicket. Latham's son Patrick Latham has played List A and Minor Counties cricket for Cambridgeshire and had second eleven matches in 1998 for both Durham and Somerset."

In 10 first-class matches, Turner averaged nearly 24 with the bat, though that was in part due to half his 12 innings ending with him not out, and his highest score was an unbeaten 24 against Warwickshire in the match where Viv Richards made 322.

Nace O'Dowd,"Nace O'Dowd (1931–1987) was a legendary footballer who played for the Sligo team in the 1950s and was a member of a number of successful Railway Cup teams. He is regarded by many GAA experts, historians and former players as one of the outstanding players of his generation and one of the greatest in Sligo's GAA history. O'Dowd was noted for his towering physique and high fielding ability as well as his gift at winning and retaining possession. He was also renowned for his leadership abilities on the field and performances which inspired his team-mates. During his Inter-county and Railway Cup career, he marked many of the prominent players of the era, and more than held his own against them. Amongst his many achievements included playing on a number of Connacht Railway Cup teams who won the competition. Representing his province was a significant accomplishment given the quality of players available for selection in Connacht at the time (three members of the 1950s team were subsequently named on the GAA Team of the Millennium) and the fact that Galway and Mayo were leading inter-county teams. The fact that O’Dowd was able to command a regular place on the Connacht team was testament to his remarkable skills as a player. His first major success was at minor level where he captained a Sligo team to a Connacht Championship in 1949. A Connacht Championship at minor level would be considered an outstanding achievement for a Sligo team in any era, that it was achieved on the eve of a decade which saw Mayo and Galway rise to the fore in Senior football made it all the more remarkable. He made his senior Inter-county debut for Sligo while still a teenager, underlining his prodigious talent and powerful physique. For the next eleven years he was a regular and consistent player for the black and white county. When the famous Galway team of the 1950s, led by ""The Terrible Twins"" Seán Purcell and Frank Stockwell, played Sligo, it was O’Dowd who was often given the unenviable task of marking Purcell, widely considered the best forward of his era, and by many the best of any era. Yet despite their on-field tussles, the friendship and respect between Purcell and O’Dowd remained off the field for many years to come, with Purcell often citing O’Dowd as one of the players he admired most in GAA. O’Dowd played for Sligo in the Connacht Final of 1954 and helped them in a memorable second half rally that almost saw them draw level with the Galway team at full-time. A controversial disallowed goal towards the end of the match cost the Sligo men the draw and replay they deserved. He lined out nine times for Connacht in the Railway Cup, helping the province to two victories. The Railway Cup offered an opportunity to the most talented players from lesser counties to demonstrate their talents and win silverware at a national level, and was considered equal in prestige to the League and All-Ireland series of the time. For many players from both stronger and weaker counties, winning a Railway Cup medal represented the pinnacle of achievement, and the competition was given far more attention than it is today. O’Dowd was a key player on the Connacht Railway Cup winning teams of 1957 and 1958. Following his emigration to America the following year, Connacht would wait another nine years before recapturing the Title. It might be considered unlucky that O’Dowd played on a Sligo team at a time when Mayo and Galway were enjoying such a period of success, Mayo winning back-to-back All-Irelands in 1950 and 1951, while Galway also winning in 1956. The Mayo and Galway teams of the era featured players of exceptional talent such as Seán Purcell, Frank Stockwell, Mattie McDonagh, Jack Mahon, Tom Langan and Sean Flanagan. It is incredible to think that three of the players O'Dowd played alongside on those Railway Cup teams, Purcell, Langan and Flanagan were named on the GAA Team of the Millennium, while McDonagh, Stockwell and Mahon remain legends in their own right. It is no surprise then that Connacht enjoyed a golden era in terms of Railway Cup success, with O’Dowd playing a prominent role in these victories. As a reward for his exceptional performances at both Inter-county and Inter-provincial level, he was selected two years in a row for the All-Ireland team to play against the Combined Universities in a number of exhibition games at Croke Park. It was an accolade which further emphasised his reputation within the game and in an era before All Star Awards, there could be no greater endorsement of a player’s ability than selection for the All-Ireland team. While Inter-county success for Sligo largely by-passed O’Dowd, at club level he enjoyed considerable achievements, which included four Sligo Club Championships and one Mayo title. Perhaps his crowning glory however was captaining his native Mullinabreena to a Sligo Senior Title in 1958, a title which still remains their only one at Senior level. He worked in several different counties as part of his job, and played for a local club Castlebar Mitchels in Mayo. Many officials and players tried to persuade him to line out for their team including for county teams. Had he played for a stronger county, it is probable he would have enjoyed far greater Inter-county success. But he remained loyal to his native Sligo throughout his career. O’Dowd emigrated to America towards the end of the 1950s, cutting short his footballing career in Ireland, but he was a popular and much sought after player in New York where he played many times in Gaelic Park. To commemorate the contribution of their most famous son, Mullinabreena named their local GAA pitch in his honour."

Peter Felix,"Peter Felix (17 July 1866 – 11 November 1926) was a boxer from Australia. Peter Felix was born on 17 July 1866 on the West Indian Island of St. Croix, the same birthplace as the immortal Peter Jackson, who he claimed to be his first cousin (Jackson was actually in Felix’s corner for some of his fights). Felix was tall for his time, standing at 6’ 3” tall, and weighing in around 180 pounds. He was said to be a flashy dresser, extravagant and a bit of an extrovert, quite the opposite of the quiet, gentlemanly Jackson. He started his pugilistic career in Australia in 1894, with a 12th round knock out win over Dan Keeley in Melbourne. The year of 1895, proved to be one of the most fruitful of his career, with three very impressive points victories over the wild man Joe Goddard, and a points victory over the superbly skilled but light punching Mick Dooley. 1896 saw him defeat Starlight Rollins, beat Mick Dooley in two out of three fights, and beat Dan Keeley for the Victorian Heavyweight title with a 5th round knock out win. The next two years saw him draw with Mick Dooley, Tut Ryan and Bill Doherty. It must also be noted that during the depression years of the 1890s that Peter Felix also fought in unofficial bouts in travelling boxing troupe’s, which toured the agricultural shows of Australia, putting on their fights in tents. Next up, he scored a draw with an old and sick Peter Jackson over 25 rounds in Melbourne, then he captured the coveted Australian Heavyweight title with a 7th round knock out win over Bill Doherty in Kalgoorlie. Racist attitudes had raised their ugly heads prior to this bout, when Doherty had beaten Dooley to win the Australian crown. Dooley has been quoted as saying “You’re too good for me, Bill, but I would sooner lose to you than Felix. Keep” - his voice broke and died to almost a whisper – “Keep the championship white”. Doherty failed to do this. Felix defended his title successfully with a 20 round draw with Doherty, but then lost it to the ubiquitous Doherty via a 20 round points loss. Felix never won the Australian title again, though he challenged for it three times, once against Doherty for a points loss in 1902, and twice against world title challenger Bill Lang for two knock out losses in 1907 and 1908 (Felix was 41 years old when he faced Lang). In Felix’s next notable bouts he beat the giant woodchopper Bill Heckenberg with a 2nd round knock out, drew with Arthur Cripps and beat the Maori, George Renaulf on points. Age was starting to catch up with the old warhorse, though he was still fighting in main events. The years of 1904 and 1905 saw him lose inside the distance against world title challengers “Boshter” Bill Squires (3 times) and “Gunner” James Moir. In 1907, Felix challenged the legendary Jack Johnson for World Coloured Heavyweight Championship. Felix was knocked out in 1 round. Felix kept fighting until 1915 (aged 48 years old), though his last real “big time” fight was in 1908 in the very first main event ever held at the Sydney Stadium, in Rushcutters Bay (the stadium where Jack Johnson beat Tommy Burns). In this fight he lost on points over 20 rounds to Sid Russell. Peter Felix retired to Sydney where he died on 10 November 1926 of a heart attack aged sixty. He fought a large number of world class fighters, and held his own against most of them. He was perhaps a bit unfortunate that his career started at the advanced age of 28 years old."

Ryū Ryū Ko,", also known as Ryuko, Ryuru Ko, Liu Liu Gung, Liu Liu Ko, To Ru Ko, was a teacher of a style possibly Fujian White Crane, notable for instructing many of the founders of Okinawan martial arts which later produced Karate. The kata Sanchin, taught in Gōjū-ryū and most other styles of Karate, was originally taught by Ryū Ryū Ko. Although Ryū Ryū Ko is mostly known from the accounts of his Okinawan students, he is sometimes known, based on the research of Tokashiki Iken, as Xie Zhongxiang, born in Changle, Fujian,. Xie Zhongxiang (謝宗祥）was also known as Xia YiYi (謝如如）in local Fukian Dialect, or Xie RuRu in modern Mandarin. Those who believe that Ryu Ryu Ko is Xie Zhongxiang refer to his alias Xie Ru Ru, whereby as a term of endearment amongst friends, he was often referred to as Ru Ru Ko，the suffix ”Ko“ （哥）meaning ""Brother"", and hence, Ru Ru Ko was a nickname for Xie Zhong Xiang which meant Brother RuRU. By some accounts he was one of the first generation masters of Míng hè quán, which he either learned from his teacher Kwan Pang Yuiba, or created himself, based on more general White Crane style of his teacher. He had to conceal his name and aristocratic lineage and took on the name Ryu Ryu Ko, under which he worked, making household goods from bamboo and cane. He has been teaching martial arts at his home to a very small group of students, which included Higaonna Kanryō, who stayed with Ryu Ryu Ko from 1867 to 1881. Ryu Ryu Ko expanded his class to an actual public school in 1883, running it with his assistant, Wai Shinzan . If Ryu Ryu Ko was indeed Xie Zhongxiang, then it is also possible that he had a son named Xie Tsuxiang. If Ryu Ryu Ko and Xie Zhongxiang were the same person, then his currently living direct descendant is his great-grandson, Xie Wenliang. Historical records provided by the Fuzhou Wushu Association show that Xie Zhong Xiang was not of aristocratic birth and never had to hide his identity. Xie Zhong Xiang worked as an apprentice shoe-maker in Fuzhou until he was 30 when he started his own martial art school, whereas accounts in the Okinawan Ryu Ryu Ko oral tradition stated that he worked as a brick-layer and basket-weaver in his later years. Karate historians do not agree with the Xie Zhongxiang identification, it's been suggested that Ryu Ryu Ko taught other styles of southern Chinese martial arts, or even that Ryu Ryu Ko was the name of the place, rather than a person. Karate historians from the Ryuei-Ryu and Goju-Ryu lineage have cited the visit by Miyagi Chojun to Fuzhou to seek Ryu Ryu Ko after Miyagi's teacher, Kanryo Higaonna died in 1915. When Miyagi Chojun arrived in Fuzhou around 1916, he was met by Ryu Ryu Ko's students, presumably someone who knew Higaonna Kanryo. Based on the oral tradition passed on by Miyagi Chojun, he was brought before Ryu Ryu Ko's grave to pay his respects. Unless Miyagi Chojun's oral history is to be disregarded, then Ryu Ryu Ko who died before 1916 and Xie Zhongxiang who died in 1930 were not the same person. Since the name ""Ryu Ryu Ko"" really existed in Okinawan tradition through the references provided by his students, any research into the identity of Ryu Ryu Ko should be based on these references. Norisato Nakaima (1819－1879 the founder of Ryūei-ryū, based the first character in the name of his style on Ryu Ryu Ko's surname. The character Norisato Nakaima used was ""劉"" which in Fuzhou dialect sounded like Liu/Ryu. Historians cite this as another piece of evidence to suggest that Xie Zhong Xiang was not Ryu Ryu Ko. According to the Ryuei Ryu Tradition, Norisato Nakaima began studying under Ryu Ryu Ko when he was 19 years old, circa 1838 to 1839 and spent 7 years learning martial arts as well as knowledge in Chinese herbal medicine from Ryu Ryu Ko. Those who dispute the claims that Xie Zhong Xiang was Ryu Ryu Ko cite the fact that Xie Zhongxiang's nickname would have been pronounced ""YiYi Go"" in Fujianese Dialect, and not ""Ru Ru Ko"", the later being a modern Mandarin pronunciation of his nickname. Taking into consideration the formality involved in a teacher's acceptance of a student into his martial arts school in those days, as it was apparent in the manner in which Kanryo Higaonna chose his own students in later years, it was deemed unlikely that Ryu Ryu Ko’s students would have referred to him by any title other than his formal name. Historical records from Fuzhou Martial Arts Association show that Xie Zhong Xiang was referred to either by his full-name or known as Yi-Shi (如师） which means Yi-Sensei in Fujianese Dialect. Those who dispute claims that Xie Zhong Xiang is Ru Ru Ko say that it is highly unlikely for Okinawan students to refer to their teacher of martial arts by his nickname ""Brother Yiyi"", and Ryu Ryu Ko's student Norisato Nakaima's claim that his Sensei's surname was ""Ryu"" (劉）is more plausible. The okinawan martial artists who are believed to have studied in Ryu Ryu Ko's school were Higaonna Kanryō, Arakaki Seishō, Norisato Nakaima, Sakiyama Kitoku, Kojo Taitei, Maezato Ranpo, Matsuda Tokusaburo ."

Tomori won the Japan's inter-high school championship in the 45 kg class in 1977, and compiled an amateur record of 16–4 (3 KOs) before turning professional. Hitoshi Misako who is the president of Misako Boxing Gym in Tokyo went to Okinawa, and encouraged Tomori to turn professional. After joining that gym in 1978, he made his professional debut at the Korakuen Hall in May of that year. In March 1979, Tomori won the annual Japanese boxing series, All-Japan Rookie King Tournament in the junior flyweight division. Although he lost on points to Kazunori Tenryū in the Japanese junior flyweight title bout in November 1979, he knocked out the sixteen-time defending champion Tenryū in the first round of the return match in February 1980 to capture the title. However he lost on points to Shūichi Hozumi in his second defense in August of that year. He competed with Masaharu Inami for the vacated title, but it also ended in a failure. Originally Tomori was an out-fighter who excelled in the speed and skill. During his professional career, he had almost mastered the in-fighting to be spotlighted. However his transformation into an in-fighter was still incomplete. So, his manager Misako made him go to the temple for the sitting meditation practice in order to discipline his mind. Tomori regained the vacant Japanese title via a close decision in October 1981, and defended it once via a unanimous decision in his first professional fight in his hometown of Naha. At that time, Misako sensed that Tomori got a boost of energy, and set a world title shot for him. On April 13, 1982, Tomori was scheduled to fight against Amado Ursúa for the WBC junior flyweight title at the Korakuen Hall. He trained under the guidance of Eddie Townsend who signed a deal with Misako Boxing Gym in March of that year. After the champion's pre-fight open workout, Koichi Wajima, Tomori's senior in the same gym, commented that he wondered if Tomori could sustain himself for three rounds. Nevertheless, he built a lead over Ursúa until the middle of the fight throwing his sharp right crosses and left jabs. In the later rounds Ursúa fought back fiercely, but was dethroned via a split decision. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Ursúa expressed dissatisfaction to the decision. His first defense against Hilario Zapata was initially scheduled in Panama City on June 5, 1982. However it was postponed to July 20 and moved to the Ishikawa Sangyō Hall in Kanazawa, Ishikawa due to Tomori's rib injury. In that first defense, Tomori lost to Zapata via a split decision. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Misako protested the decision of the judges to the WBC, and Tomori had a rematch with Zapata as a challenger at the Kuramae Kokugikan on November 30 of the same year. However Tomori who had believed his own victory in the previous fight, told that he would not be able to fight more than he did on July 20. He suffered a cut above his left eye from the sixth round, and was stopped in the eighth round after being floored in the seventh and eighth rounds. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Some time after that fight, Tomori hung up his gloves."

Though born in Australia, Dickinson was educated in England at Blackburn Grammar School and Manchester University. A right-arm fast-medium bowler and a left-handed tail-end batsman, he played Lancashire League cricket for East Lancashire from the age of 15 and made his first-class debut for Lancashire as a 19-year-old in 1950. Such was the dominance of Lancashire's spin attack of Roy Tattersall, Bob Berry, Malcolm Hilton and Peter Greenwood that Dickinson bowled only 56 overs in his four matches for the side in 1950 and 1951, never taking more than one wicket in any innings. In the mid-1950s, he turned out for The Army in non-first-class matches. Then, in August 1957, he was given an extended trial by Somerset, appearing in five consecutive matches. In his first match, against Glamorgan, he took five wickets for 36 in the first innings, sharing all 10 wickets in the innings with Bryan Lobb, who took five for 63. In the following match, he was again Somerset's most successful bowler against a full-strength Surrey side heading for its sixth consecutive County Championship: he took four for 80, though Surrey won the match. But after taking 17 wickets at an average of less than 20 runs per wicket, he decided against a career in cricket and did not appear in first-class matches again, though he appeared for Somerset's second eleven in Minor Counties matches in the school holidays in 1958. Dickinson's batting was negligible, and in nine first-class matches he did not ever reach double figures. The Somerset historian David Foot, however, remembers his batting style: ""More than once I saw him switch from left to right hand in the middle of an over – not to attempt the contentious reverse sweep but to deceive the fielders and show he could play the cover drive on both sides,"" he wrote. ""They used to say he could also bowl with either hand."""
